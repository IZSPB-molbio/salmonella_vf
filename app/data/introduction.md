This dashboard offers a graphical overview of genome screening for antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes in *Salmonella enterica* isolates from serovars Infantis and Napoli, as performed with [ABRicate](https://github.com/tseemann/abricate).

The **ABRicate: overview** section offers a summary of resistance and virulence genes found in your genomes.

The **ABRicate: results** section reports an interactive table with complete ABRicate results.

The **Phylogeny** section shows a cgSNP-based phylogenetic tree including the following *Salmonella enterica* serovars:
- Infantis
- Napoli
- Enteritidis
- Typhimurium
- Virchow
- Victoria (outgroup)

The multiple sequence alignment used to compute the phylogenetic tree was calculated through the [Roary](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/) pangenome pipeline. The phylogenetic tree was calculated with [FastTree](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/).

Data in this dashboard were generated by **Laura Del Sambro**, **Domenico Simone** and **Antonio Parisi** (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale di Puglia e Basilicata, Putignano - BA).
